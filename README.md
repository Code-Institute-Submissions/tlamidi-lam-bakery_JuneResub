Welcome tlamidi,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.


Happy coding!

My name is Tony Lamidi. I am a student at code institute, studying Diploma in software engineering.

This is my first read me and that means this is my first project.
My project is about a sweet bread house. It is about a bakery in London. In a nut shell, a bakery house, where they produce sweet bread.
I happened to run the bakery at a time in London as the bakery manager and owner.
The bread was a little bit different, it was a sweet bread with considerable amount of sugar and butter and margerine among other things. The bakery House was situated on 163, camberwell new road, London. Se15 5qj.
 The is about the bakery pride, our products, our mission, the equipments, and our environment couple with our ingredients. Closing hours, and our presence in the social media.
What make the bakery outlet unique was the sweetness in the bread. This in a way targeted largely some group of people, african, caribbean set of people, and other groups. The whole set up was very significant in general to the targeted communities.
The design is a simple one. With a picture of a loaf sliced

The project is a one page project

I have the main heading that reads, " SWEET BREAD HOUSE". This is under h1 heading. Along side it are three anchors that tend to link to local page and server, html files.
Nav element is a great grand parent to anchor that is wrapped inside the list element. This also wrapped inside the unordered list element 'ul'.

The heading h1, is alligned to the top left. And the anchor links are alligned to the right.
This is made possible in the style sheet by invoking floating left and floating right on the h1 element handle and the ul element respectfully.

The design is followed by the picture of a sliced bread , and part of the slice is cut into two. This serve as the main picture. In the style sheet, the height and width were assigned accordingly.

h2 heading followed after. This is captioned, reason for loving us. That is to say, why we are unique.
p paragraph explaining our stand in been one of the best bakery followed. Both the h2 and the p elements characteristics were defined in the style sheet. Their font sizes , boldness in terms of font weight and their respective positioning were contained in the style sheet. 
Another picture depicting people coming into the shop to purchase bread also featured. `The second picture was positioned under the first picture to the right by using the top and left codes with values in percentages

The headings two in numbers, and the 2 paragraphs that follows touched on our mission and our products.

The second pair of the h2 and p element are positioned right , side by side with the first pair of h2 and p elements connecting to our mission, and our project respectively.

The codes used to move h2 and p element in between our mission and our products, are codes positioning relatively, top, and left codes and the display inline option. The code used are top, left, position, and display codes.

Equipments and ingredients lists are next in the design. Both list are wraped inside unordered lists,
and the ,two sets of lists are placed side by side. As it is with unorder list element, ul, li, and if made navigational the anchor element a, usual codes of text-decoration as none, also, top, left, absolute positioning, inline display, including fonts settings codes are used.

Our contact details are followed. Our address, telephone number. Also it includes our email address. The posittioning codes are employed to move the email around. Scan element are used fro both phone and email-address. They are configured with also, font size, weight, height, and family. This is also placed within a div and larger umbrela of section element.

Nav element was used in the logo and the menu at the top of the page. This make the navigation easy by wrapping within it an anchor 'a' element.

The table for our opening time with a heading captioned "Our closing time" follows.
The table element is wrapped inside a div element, including , tr, th, and td, elements.
The div is inside a section element. The inclusion of div element for the table element setup is to make the table responsive.

Next in the design is the footer. A heading, and a paragraph, a div and the ul, li, and 'a' elements are used.
The footer included heading and a paragraph. It also includes the link to four major social media. A navigative element anchor 'a' are used to do the tasks. For easy boxing , a div element was used to contain the social media links.


 
the pair also sits side by sides

Next in the design are the unordered lists of codethe display with the value of 

position command  and text allign, padding margin, floating right, font -family, text-weight,
height, width are deployed to position the anchor links, and the main heading in the positions 
where they are.

The code to remove text decoration and the list style type use to eliminate such on the anchor and the ul 
element.

The picture come right under the anchor and the main heading.
The codes such as width, height, borders, margin, padding used to fix the picture in the position it is.
The picture covered about 70 percent of the total width.

Reason for loving the bread is next in the design. Or better put it people's love for the bakery. That was explained in a paragraph that followed the picture. 

Next two paragraphs that follows depict the bakery mission and what the bakery stands for. The 2 paragraphs narrate in full the details.

Next is the ul element to be used in providing the list of equipments. Codes to manage the font, weight, text height and decoration are put together.

After the equipments , come the list of products. The div and ul elements including li element are used.
Codes are written in the style lists to manage the product.

The Opening and Closing time of the bakery including the days of the week follows after. Shortly before the table of opening and closing time are, our address, phone number, and email address of the  bakery outlet. The table is wrapped inside a div element. This is to enable responsive design.
We make our self known in all the major social media including , twitter, you-tube, facebook, and instagram.
The sub heading that indicate our presence on the social media is align to the left.
All the items representing the social media are laid horizontally allign to the right. The social media platforms included in this project with a link connection to the rightful sight as indicated, employed anchor element as the link element to the social platforms. This is tested and opened in the new window connecting the site intended.

Footer element is used as the main element to wrap all other elements for our bakery social media connections.

Testing

All the social media configured in the project were tested and connect perfectly. Including twitter, facebook, instagram,and you-tube.


W3C Validation programme was used to test and check for the errors in the project. It was clear of any error. Likewise the style sheet, it was equally tested and free of errors.

Identation

indent.rainbow file was installed. This is to put in place a check whereby to have a proper indentation for the codes, in both index file and and style sheet.
