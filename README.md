This project is about a sweet bread shop located in a local area of the south east London in UK. It is basically a bakery outlet baking and selling a unique sweet bread rich in butter and sugar. There is a particular group of people targeted by the sweet bread shop. Other group of people are beginning to patronise the bakery , and this is through the word of mouth spreading across. But this could be more. This project is to creat an awareness to people out there, and people in the area who could be interested but yet to know about the bakery sweet bread. In a nut shell, the project is to reach out to more people near and far for patronage.

The title of the project is Sweet Bread House.The whole idea about the project is to describe the bread shop on-line and that the other people out there would be aware and patronise the bakery shop.

I happened to run the bakery at a time in London as the bakery manager.
The bread was a little bit different, it was a sweet bread with considerable amount of sugar and butter and margerine among other things. The bakery House was situated on 163, camberwell new road, London. Se15 5qj.
The project included the bakery pride statement, the products, the mission statement, the equipments, and the environment couple with the ingredients. Closing hours, and our presence in the social media were also included in the project.

The design is a simple one. With a picture of a loaf slice. The project is a one page project

I have the main heading that reads, " SWEET BREAD HOUSE". This is under h1 heading. Along side it are three anchors that tend to link to local page and server, html files.
Nav element is a great grand parent to anchor that is wrapped inside the list element. This also wrapped inside the unordered list element 'ul'.

The heading h1, is alligned to the top left. And the anchor links are alligned to the right.
This is made possible in the style sheet by invoking floating left and floating right on the h1 element handle and the ul element respectfully.

The design is followed by the picture of a sliced bread , and part of the slice is cut into two. This serve as the main picture. In the style sheet, the height and width were assigned accordingly.

h2 heading followed after. This is captioned, reason for loving us. That is to say, why we are unique.
p paragraph explaining our stand in been one of the best bakery followed. Both the h2 and the p elements characteristics were defined in the style sheet. Their font sizes , boldness in terms of font weight and their respective positioning were contained in the style sheet. 
Another picture depicting people coming into the shop to purchase bread also featured. `The second picture was positioned under the first picture to the right by using the top and left codes with values in percentages

The headings two in numbers, and the 2 paragraphs that follows touched on our mission and our products.

The second pair of the h2 and p element are positioned right , side by side with the first pair of h2 and p elements connecting to our mission, and our project respectively.

The codes used to move h2 and p element in between our mission and our products, are codes positioning relatively, top, and left codes and the display inline option coded in css file. The code used are top, left, position, and display codes.

Equipments and ingredients lists are next in the design. Both list are wraped inside unordered lists,
and the ,two sets of lists are placed side by side. As it is with unorder list element, ul, li, and if made navigational the anchor element a, usual codes of text-decoration as none, also, top, left, absolute positioning, inline display, including fonts settings codes are used.

Our contact details are followed. Our address, telephone number. Also it includes our email address. The posittioning codes are employed to move the email around. Scan element are used fro both phone and email-address. They are configured with also, font size, weight, height, and family. This is also placed within a div and larger umbrela of section element.

Nav element was used in the logo and the menu at the top of the page. This make the navigation easy by wrapping within it an anchor 'a' element.

The table for our opening time with a heading captioned "Our closing time" follows.
The table element is wrapped inside a div element, including , tr, th, and td, elements.
The div is inside a section element. The inclusion of div element for the table element setup is to make the table responsive.

Next in the design is the footer. A heading, and a paragraph, a div and the ul, li, and 'a' elements are used.
The footer included heading and a paragraph. It also includes the link to four major social media. A navigative element anchor 'a' are used to do the tasks. For easy boxing , a div element was used to contain the social media links.

All the social media configured in the project were tested and connect perfectly. Including twitter, facebook, instagram,and you-tube.


W3C Validation programme was used to test and check for the errors in the project. It was clear of any error in Html file. Likewise the style sheet, the css file, it was equally tested and free of errors.
